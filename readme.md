# Web Scraping in Python 3 using Scrapy

## Save the scrapped data as file (json/xml/csv)

  > JSON: `scrapy crawl quotes -o quotes.json`
  > XML: `scrapy crawl quotes -o quotes.xml`
  > CSV: `scrapy crawl quotes -o quotes.csv`

  here **scrapy crawl** is the command, followed by **quotes** as the name of the scrape operation and finally the filename, i.e **quotes.json(also .xml and .csv)**
